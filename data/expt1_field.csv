8,1/1/2024,47,Male,None,0,B,B,B,B,B,F,Down,Down,"Also mentioned beam appears brightest at horizon, and this supports idea that source is in front. Also deliberately sketched beam as passing over lighthouse. Original phantom responses were B,F,F,B and at d = 60 asked to change previous two responses to B. Expressed uncertainty about the task -- not sure whether the source was in front or behind."
